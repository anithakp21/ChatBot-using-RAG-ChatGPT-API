              "[Document(page_content=\"I'm here outside Surrey Court. It's Bansi Accommodation. I'm going to take you on a tour around my flat. So this is my room. I think it's pretty decent actually. It's a good size. You don't really need bigger than this, I don't think. And obviously Bansi is really good value for what you get, I think. So although it's shared bathrooms in Bansi, you do get a sink in your room, which is great. Because it means you can do your hair, makeup, brush your teeth, whatever in your room. And then you only really have to leave to use the toilet or shower, so I think that's really good. So obviously I'm on the ground floor in this room, but it's fine. You get people walking past you and sometimes it can be a bit noisy, but in general it's not too bad. They tend to give you net curtains as well if you're on the ground floor, which is good because it means no one can look in. It's a lot better when you get in the Tesco order or anything because you don't have to run up four flights of stairs. With maintenance issues and things, they tend to be pretty good. You just go and report it online and they come and fix it the next day. And they're not really worried about trying to catch you out and charge you and stuff like that. They just tend to replace it. Like my radiator broke and they come and fix it the next day, no problem. So they're pretty good with stuff like that. You get loads of storage space in your room as well. So you get a chest of drawers, there's a desk, shelves, wardrobe, space above your wardrobe, space below your sink. And under your bed as well. So there's loads of space to put all your stuff. You get a huge notice board, you can customise it, put whatever you want on. Really make your room feel like your own. So in Surrey and Battersea Court we share with 14 people in the flat. Now living with 14 people, it's absolutely fine. People think it's going to be an issue with sharing the kitchen or sharing the bathrooms and stuff. It's just not a problem. Everyone's using them at different times. No one's ever in the kitchen all at the same time or popping freshers week. It's really sociable. There's always someone around and you're pretty much guaranteed to get someone you like living with you as well. And everyone kind of decorates their doors and stuff as well. And sharing the bathrooms isn't really a problem as well because you share bathrooms at home, you share bathrooms here as well. It's just not an issue because everyone gets on, so it's fine. The showers are great as well. They're really powerful, the water pressure is really good. You get heated towel rail and we've brought a couple of bath mats as well, so we share them in the showers as well. There's three showers and three toilets on our floor. Now people think we have to queue or have a rota or something like that, but it's just not the case at all. Everyone gets up at different times, uses the shower at different times, so there's really not an issue. And there's never been a time throughout the whole year where anyone has had to wait to use the toilet or shower. So I really wouldn't worry about that. The shared bathroom is absolutely fine. So this is the kitchen. It's quite big obviously because there's 14 of us, but we're kind of rarely all in here at once cooking and stuff. So you don't really need to worry about 14 people all trying to get on the hobs at once. It just doesn't really work like that. And people kind of stage it, so at different times of the night people will come and do their cooking. So you don't really need to worry, it doesn't get too crowded in here. We also get cleaning as well. So the cleaning's all done for us. They come five times a fortnight and just clean everything. They're really good. So things like the oven gets cleaned out, freezers defrosted, microwave's cleaned, tables wiped down, everything like that. So you don't really have to worry and there's no arguments about who has to do the cleaning, things like that. And likewise the toilets and showers get cleaned for you as well. In terms of cupboard space and stuff, we all get one big cupboard at the bottom. And then everyone gets half of a cupboard at the top as well. So there's plenty of space to put all your stuff. And there's a couple of shared cupboards as well that we can put stuff in. In the fridges and freezers we get one shelf each as well, which again is fine, there's plenty of space. In terms of the appliances in the kitchen, there's a microwave, two kettles, a toaster, two sinks, two sets of hobs and an oven. And then also people tend to bring with them blenders, rice cookers, things like that. And we all just share them now as well. Because like I said, everyone's friendly, everyone gets on. As you can see behind me, the pictures and things like that. We've kind of decorated the kitchen. It's our own really, it's our home and it's really nice. Within Sewing Baths Seacourt as well, in each block there's four floors of 14 flats. So we all know each other within the block as well. And we tend to go to one floor every week for pre-drinks.\", metadata={'source': '/content/youtube/Accommodation Student Tour (Band C - Surrey Court).m4a', 'chunk': 0})]"

              "Document(page_content=\"I'm here outside Surrey Court. It's Bansi Accommodation. I'm going to take you on a tour around my flat. So this is my room. I think it's pretty decent actually. It's a good size. You don't really need bigger than this, I don't think. And obviously Bansi is really good value for what you get, I think. So although it's shared bathrooms in Bansi, you do get a sink in your room, which is great. Because it means you can do your hair, makeup, brush your teeth, whatever in your room. And then you only really have to leave to use the toilet or shower, so I think that's really good. So obviously I'm on the ground floor in this room, but it's fine. You get people walking past you and sometimes it can be a bit noisy, but in general it's not too bad. They tend to give you net curtains as well if you're on the ground floor, which is good because it means no one can look in. It's a lot better when you get in the Tesco order or anything because you don't have to run up four flights of stairs. With maintenance issues and things, they tend to be pretty good. You just go and report it online and they come and fix it the next day. And they're not really worried about trying to catch you out and charge you and stuff like that. They just tend to replace it. Like my radiator broke and they come and fix it the next day, no problem. So they're pretty good with stuff like that. You get loads of storage space in your room as well. So you get a chest of drawers, there's a desk, shelves, wardrobe, space above your wardrobe, space below your sink. And under your bed as well. So there's loads of space to put all your stuff. You get a huge notice board, you can customise it, put whatever you want on. Really make your room feel like your own. So in Surrey and Battersea Court we share with 14 people in the flat. Now living with 14 people, it's absolutely fine. People think it's going to be an issue with sharing the kitchen or sharing the bathrooms and stuff. It's just not a problem. Everyone's using them at different times. No one's ever in the kitchen all at the same time or popping freshers week. It's really sociable. There's always someone around and you're pretty much guaranteed to get someone you like living with you as well. And everyone kind of decorates their doors and stuff as well. And sharing the bathrooms isn't really a problem as well because you share bathrooms at home, you share bathrooms here as well. It's just not an issue because everyone gets on, so it's fine. The showers are great as well. They're really powerful, the water pressure is really good. You get heated towel rail and we've brought a couple of bath mats as well, so we share them in the showers as well. There's three showers and three toilets on our floor. Now people think we have to queue or have a rota or something like that, but it's just not the case at all. Everyone gets up at different times, uses the shower at different times, so there's really not an issue. And there's never been a time throughout the whole year where anyone has had to wait to use the toilet or shower. So I really wouldn't worry about that. The shared bathroom is absolutely fine. So this is the kitchen. It's quite big obviously because there's 14 of us, but we're kind of rarely all in here at once cooking and stuff. So you don't really need to worry about 14 people all trying to get on the hobs at once. It just doesn't really work like that. And people kind of stage it, so at different times of the night people will come and do their cooking. So you don't really need to worry, it doesn't get too crowded in here. We also get cleaning as well. So the cleaning's all done for us. They come five times a fortnight and just clean everything. They're really good. So things like the oven gets cleaned out, freezers defrosted, microwave's cleaned, tables wiped down, everything like that. So you don't really have to worry and there's no arguments about who has to do the cleaning, things like that. And likewise the toilets and showers get cleaned for you as well. In terms of cupboard space and stuff, we all get one big cupboard at the bottom. And then everyone gets half of a cupboard at the top as well. So there's plenty of space to put all your stuff. And there's a couple of shared cupboards as well that we can put stuff in. In the fridges and freezers we get one shelf each as well, which again is fine, there's plenty of space. In terms of the appliances in the kitchen, there's a microwave, two kettles, a toaster, two sinks, two sets of hobs and an oven. And then also people tend to bring with them blenders, rice cookers, things like that. And we all just share them now as well. Because like I said, everyone's friendly, everyone gets on. As you can see behind me, the pictures and things like that. We've kind of decorated the kitchen. It's our own really, it's our home and it's really nice. Within Sewing Baths Seacourt as well, in each block there's four floors of 14 flats. So we all know each other within the block as well. And we tend to go to one floor every week for pre-drinks.\", metadata={'source': '/content/youtube/Accommodation Student Tour (Band C - Surrey Court).m4a', 'chunk': 0})"
