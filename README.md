Chatbot that combines LangChain's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with vector database for efficient information retrieval


Vector Database : A vector database is a collection of data stored as mathematical representations called vectors. Vector databases make it easier for machine learning models to remember previous inputs.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): RAG combines an information retrieval component with a text generator model. It takes an input and retrieves a set of relevant/supporting documents given a source
